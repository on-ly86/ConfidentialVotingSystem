# Confidential Voting System - Corporate Governance/Compliance Solution

A privacy-preserving decentralized corporate governance solution leveraging **Zama’s Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** and **Web3 technologies**.  
This system enables sensitive data to remain encrypted throughout its lifecycle while still being processed, striking a balance between **confidentiality** and **usability**.  
It is designed for enterprise governance and compliance use cases, ensuring both **privacy protection** and **auditability**.

## Project Background

Corporate governance and compliance require handling highly sensitive data such as employee votes, compliance reports, and internal audits. Traditional systems often fail to guarantee privacy, transparency, and fairness:

• **Privacy Risk**: Administrators may have access to raw data, risking leaks or misuse  
• **Lack of Trust**: Employees fear exposure, retaliation, or manipulation of results  
• **Opaque Processes**: No verifiable way to prove results were counted correctly  
• **Limited Insights**: Secure aggregation and alerts are missing in traditional systems  

**Confidential Voting System** addresses these challenges by:  

• Using FHE to keep all submitted votes encrypted end-to-end  
• Supporting encrypted aggregation for **category statistics** and **threshold-based alerts**  
• Restricting administrators to view **only aggregated results**, never raw votes  
• Providing **zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP)** for verifiable audit logs  
• Enabling compliance-driven **privacy guarantees** tailored for corporate governance  

## Features

### Core Functionality

• **Encrypted Vote Submission**: Employees cast votes encrypted with FHE  
• **Secure Aggregation**: Votes aggregated without exposing individual ballots  
• **Threshold Alerts**: Configurable alerts triggered when encrypted counts exceed predefined limits  
• **Admin Dashboard**: Management only sees aggregated, encrypted results  
• **Real-time Compliance Dashboard**: Encrypted insights into governance-related metrics  

### Privacy & Security

• **End-to-End Encryption**: Votes remain encrypted throughout submission, processing, and storage  
• **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**: Cryptographic proofs ensure correctness of tallying and aggregation  
• **Immutable Audit Logs**: Blockchain-backed audit records cannot be tampered with  
• **Minimal Trust Assumptions**: Neither administrators nor system operators see plaintext data  

## Architecture

### Smart Contracts

**ConfidentialVotingSystem.sol** (Ethereum-compatible chain)  

• Manages encrypted vote submissions  
• Stores immutable encrypted records  
• Provides aggregation and threshold alerts in encrypted state  
• Supports ZK-proof verification for audit purposes  

### Backend Services

• **Zama FHE Engine**: Performs homomorphic operations on encrypted data  
• **ZK Audit Module**: Generates proofs for compliance and auditability  
• **Alerting Service**: Triggers notifications on encrypted threshold conditions  

### Frontend Application

• **React + TypeScript**: Interactive web interface  
• **Ethers.js**: Smart contract interaction layer  
• **TailwindCSS**: Responsive UI design  
• **Compliance Dashboard**: View aggregated encrypted insights  

## Technology Stack

### Blockchain Layer

• **Solidity ^0.8.24**: Smart contract development  
• **OpenZeppelin**: Security libraries and contract templates  
• **Hardhat**: Development, testing, and deployment framework  
• **Ethereum Sepolia Testnet**: Current testing environment  

### Cryptography Layer

• **Zama FHE SDK**: Homomorphic encryption for encrypted computation  
• **zk-SNARKs / zk-STARKs**: Zero-knowledge proof frameworks  
• **Threshold Cryptography**: For secure distributed key management  

### Frontend Layer

• **React 18 + TypeScript**: UI framework  
• **Ethers.js**: Blockchain interaction  
• **Tailwind + CSS**: Styling  
• **Vercel**: Deployment platform  

## Installation

### Prerequisites

• Node.js 18+  
• npm / yarn / pnpm  
• Ethereum wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)  

### Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Deploy to network (configure hardhat.config.js first)
npx hardhat run deploy/deploy.ts --network sepolia

# Start the frontend
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run dev server
npm run dev
```

## Usage

• **Submit Encrypted Vote**: Cast a vote without revealing plaintext  
• **View Aggregated Results**: Management dashboard displays encrypted statistics  
• **Threshold Alerts**: Receive secure alerts when governance KPIs cross limits  
• **Verify Audit Logs**: Use ZK proofs to confirm system correctness  

## Security Features

• **Homomorphic Encryption**: Votes processed without decryption  
• **ZK-Proof Audits**: Mathematical guarantees of integrity  
• **Immutable Storage**: On-chain records cannot be altered  
• **Minimal Disclosure**: Only aggregated insights exposed, never raw votes  

## Future Enhancements

• **Multi-chain Deployment**: Expand to additional blockchain ecosystems  
• **Advanced Compliance Templates**: Industry-specific compliance rulesets  
• **Mobile-Friendly UI**: Optimized mobile access for employees and auditors  
• **DAO Integration**: Governance-driven evolution of the compliance system
